# CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project 0
This is a repository for project 0 of CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to build a website which mimics Google search, advanced search, and image search pages functionality as well as design.

This was the first time I used HTLM or CSS for anything so I found it insightful.
